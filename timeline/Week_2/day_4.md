# Day 4

On this day i started to design the database schema from using DrawSQL which is an easy tool that you can use it for doing that, and the designed db schema is [here](https://drawsql.app/teams/test-1748/diagrams/instagram).

This is the tables which i wroked in :

1. User
2. Post
3. Post Image
4. Story
5. Chat
6. Message

I done these tables and its fields, but i think it's need to be refactored ,So this is will gonna be the task of the next day.
