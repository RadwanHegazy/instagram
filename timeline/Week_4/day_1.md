# Day 1

In this day I wrote the test files for app 'users', The written tests is for : 

1. login endpoint
2. register endpoint
3. profile endpoint

Then I use my lib [`social auth`](https://github.com/RadwanHegazy/dj_social_auth) to implement login with fb to my project.

So,By doing these things the authenticated system has been done successfully.
