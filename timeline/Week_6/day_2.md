# Day 2

I started to create a custom middleware for implement JWT authentication for GraphQL endpoint and i use this middleware for only `get_user_timeline`, and i do more two custom quries likes : 

1. get post by post id
2. get posts by owner username

And after doing that i write test files for each one of them for check that the endpoint work successfully.
