# Day 5

Today I write some edit on classes `LikePostNotification` and `FollowNotification` which is on `globals/notifications.py` for sending the real-time notification when call method `send()`.

After that I edit the nginx configuration for accept the websocket connection, Then i write some edit in docker-compose and remove all ports from the service exept nginx and still bind on port 80
