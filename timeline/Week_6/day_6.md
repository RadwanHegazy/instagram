# Day 6

Today I started to create these endpoints : 

1. love post
2. unlove post
3. follow user
4. unfollow user

After that I integerate the notifiction model which i created it yesterday for send a real-time notifications when user follow another user and when user love a post.

When i finished i write test files for each endpoint i created and test the whole system when i finished for checking that all thing is working successfully.
