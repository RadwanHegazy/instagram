# Day 1

Today I starts to create an endpoint for get user timline using graphql

`NOTE`: I was already created this endpoint but using REST APIs, but I changed it to GraphQL.

**First :** I installed `graphene-django` and follow up this [documentation](https://docs.graphene-python.org/projects/django/en/latest/) to integerate and use the library.

**Secend :** I created the GrapQL endpoint and faces some issues and bugs but i slove all of it and finally i build the GraphQL endpoint in `/posts/get/` , and the endpoint return all the user followings posts depends on the request user.
